# Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on in the past few months

* [**arima**](https://github.com/rohankmr414/arima) - A distributed, fault-tolerant, key-value store
    * The data is persisted on the disk using [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger). Replication and fault-tolerance is achieved using [Raft](https://raft.github.io).
    * It also provides a simple HTTP API for accessing the data.
* [**anime-dl**](https://github.com/rohankmr414/anime-dl) - A simple CLI to download anime
    * Uses [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to scrape the anime page and download the episodes.
    * The package can be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anime-dl/).
* [**nighteye**](https://github.com/rohankmr414/nighteye) - Crypto price prediction using LSTM layers
    * The data was collected using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) api.
    * The model is trained using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and deployed using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
