# Hi, I'm Rohan

I am a Junior at KIIT, Bhubaneswar studying Computer Science and Engineering. I started programming around 3 years ago when I joined college and have been trying to improve ever since. I am mostly interested in Systems Engineering and Backend Development. Currently learning more of Golang and Linux internals to understand Docker and Kubernetes. Recently I've been trying to get involved in the open source community and have been trying to contribute to <a href="https://argoproj.github.io" target="_blank">argo</a>. I'm currently working as a DevOps Intern at <a href="https://machaao.com" target="_blank">Machaao Inc</a> currently working on the organization's logging architecture.
